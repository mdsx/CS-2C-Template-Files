The files in this folder contain the template implementations of the various ADTs
and some specific helper files described in the course.  Move or copy 
them into your IDE's project folder where include and/or source files normally go.

In Visual C++ on Windows this is your project directory.  If, for example, your 
project is named "Foothill", this will usually be the directory:

   C:\Users\<YOU>\Documents\Visual Studio 2012\Projects\Foothill\Foothill

(Note that it's going into the inner of the two identical Foothill directories.)

In Eclipse on a Mac this is in your workspace/project dir/source.  If "Foothill" 
is the name of your project, this will usually be the directory:

  Mac_HD/Users/<YOU>/Documents/workspace/Projects/Foothill/source

In any project that uses them, "add" each file in the "header files" (for .h files)
or "source files" (for .cpp files) section of the explorer window for easy access.  
For a Windows PC, e.g., in order to add a .h file, right click on "Header Files" 
in your project explorer window and "add->Existing item", and browse to select it.  

For a Eclipse on a Mac, this may not be necessary; they may appear automatically 
when you copy the files to your source directory.

Finally, in your client source, #include the appropriate file name(s).
